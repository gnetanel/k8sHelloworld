Pre-requiste:
Install Docker and k8s (can be done using microk8s which simlify installation with cluster with single node of installed pc)

# Install microk8s & docker
sudo snap install microk8s --classic --channel=1.19
snap install docker

# Build docker for self testing: 
# In app directory: 
# Build docker image (username is your user name  in docker hub) 
docker build . -t username/helloworld:1.0, in below example it is gnetanel
# to test it run
docker run -i -p 8080:80 gnetanel/helloworld:1.0
# connect to port 8080 in local browser to see hello world printout 

#upload docker image to docker hub, for that you need an account...
docker login  # you would be prompt for user/pass in docker hub.
# push it to your user account , below it is gnetanel
docker push gnetanel/helloworld:1.0

# now - testing this with kubernetes
# cd to k8s
# in the deployoment.yaml file, modify the image: gnetanel/helloworld:1.0 with your image on docker hub.
# Create the deployment
microk8s.kubectl create -f deployment.yaml
# now you can verify two pods were created by running
microk8s.kubectl get pods
# delete pods to see other come instead
microk8s.kubectl delete POD_NAME # choose one you get form microk8s.kutectl get pods command
# wait and see other one created by running 
microk8s.kubectl get pods

#Now lets run the load balancer:
microk8s.kubectl create lb.yaml

# to check service, run
microk8s.kubectl get svc
